# **App Name**: Racket Road

## Core Features:

- Drag and Drop UI: Drag-and-drop interface for creating Racket list expressions.
- Pill Elements: Pill-shaped elements to represent functions, conditions, variables, operators and strings.
- Color Coding: Color-coded pills: purple (functions), blue (conditions/operators), orange (variables), green (strings).
- Incomplete Expression Indicators: Visual indicators (colored dots) at the end of incomplete expressions.
- AI Syntax Checker: Automatic checking to confirm list follows a standard Racket syntax (prefix notation) via AI tool.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#9400D3) to give prominence to functions.
- Background color: Desaturated purple (#F0E6FF) to not detract from pill elements
- Accent color: Complementary violet (#8A2BE2) for interactions and to suggest forward motion in the assembling of code.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif, to ensure code is clear and legible.
- Simple, geometric icons for drag handles and functional operations, consistent with the Racket language's aesthetic.
- Clean and uncluttered design to facilitate focus on the list construction.
- Smooth drag-and-drop transitions with a slight 'pop' effect when connecting elements to indicate a successful link.
